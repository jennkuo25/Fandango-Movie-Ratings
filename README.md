# Fandango-Movie-Ratings

## Motivation
Hickey found that there is a significant discrepancy in the number of stars displayed and actual user ratings on Fandango in this great piece of [data journalism](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/). Hickey showed that the ratings are skewed left meaning that the ratings are generally high or very high. After publication of his analysis, Fandango officials attributed the discrepancy to a bug in the system. Here, I look at whether the ratings have changed since Hickey's analysis of the movies on Fandango in 2015 compared to the following year.

## Data
Hickey made his dataset publicly available on [Github](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/fandango) and the Fandango movie ratings for movies released in 2016 were made available [here](https://github.com/mircealex/Movie_ratings_2016_17).
